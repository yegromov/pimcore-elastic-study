## Docker

PHP Beauty project assumes you're using Docker to run your local environment.
You don't need to have a PHP environment with composer installed.

### Prerequisits

* Your user must be allowed to run docker commands (directly or via sudo).
* You must have docker-compose installed.
* Your user must be allowed to change file permissions (directly or via sudo).
* You may need to put SELinux in Permissive mode: ``setenforce permissive``.

## TO-DO List

* Varnish is not yet properly configured, so nginx is listening 8080 port because Varnish is expected to operate on 80 port.
